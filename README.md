## Project Overview
This project explores movie industry data to support our company’s plan to launch a new movie studio. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we analyze genre performance, production spending, box office outcomes, and audience ratings. The goal is to identify the types of films the studio should invest in to maximize box office success.


## Business Goal
Provide data-driven recommendations on the types of movies our studio should produce by examining historical movie trends across multiple datasets.

## Objectives
1. Which genres are most expensive to produce?
Identify genres with the highest production budgets.
3. Which genres are the best performing worldwide?
Rank genres by total worldwide gross.
3. What is the relationship between production budget and profit?
Analyze trends in spending versus earnings to determine whether larger budgets result in higher profits.
4. How do audience ratings impact movie performance?
Explore correlations between ratings and financial success.

##  Data sources
- **The Numbers (TN)** — production budgets & grosses  
- **Box Office Mojo (BOM)** — grosses  
- **IMDB (SQLite)** — titles, genres, ratings (`average_rating`), and votes (`num_votes`)  
- _Optional_: Rotten Tomatoes / TheMovieDB for critic or metadata signals (if included)

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL (if used for IMDB datasets)
- Git / GitHub

##  Expected Deliverables
Clean merged dataset
EDA visualizations (genre trends, scatterplots, correlations)
Insights on profitability, spending efficiency, and genre strengths
Final business recommendations

## ⭐ Business Recommendations
1. Based on the most expensive genres: Do not rely on audience ratings when predicting profit—budget and genre matter more. Focus on Action and Adventure films for the highest box-office potential.
2. Based on best-performing genres: Invest in high-budget projects, as they are more likely to generate strong profits.
3. Based on the relationship between budget and profit: Include some lower-cost genres (e.g., Comedy, Animation) to balance financial risk.
4. Based on audience rating and performance: Do not rely on audience ratings when predicting profit—budget and genre matter more.

## Key Business Takeaways
1. Most Expensive Genres
➡️ Plan higher budgets for these, but balance with low-budget films to reduce risk.

2. Best-Performing Genres
➡️ Prioritize these genres while using Comedy or Animation for steady, lower-risk returns.

3. Budget vs. Profit
➡️ Invest confidently in big-budget films—especially in high-performing genres.

4. Ratings vs. Profit
➡️ Focus on budget strategy and genre selection over user ratings.
