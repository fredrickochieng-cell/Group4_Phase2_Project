# Project Overview
This project explores movie industry data to support our company’s plan to launch a new movie studio. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we analyze genre performance, production spending, box office outcomes, and audience ratings. The goal is to identify what types of films the studio should invest in to maximize success at the box office.


# Business Goal
Provide data-driven recommendations on the types of movies our studio should produce by examining historical movie trends across multiple datasets.

# Objectives
1. Which genres are most expensive to produce?
*Identify genres with the highest production budgets.
2. Which genres are the best performing worldwide?
*Rank genres by total worldwide gross.
3. What is the relationship between production budget and profit?
*Analyze trends in spending versus earnings to determine whether larger budgets result in higher profits.
4. How do audience ratings impact movie performance?
*Explore correlations between ratings and financial success.
