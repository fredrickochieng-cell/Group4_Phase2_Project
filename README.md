# Project Overview
This project explores movie industry data to support our company’s plan to launch a new movie studio. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we analyze genre performance, production spending, box office outcomes, and audience ratings. The goal is to identify what types of films the studio should invest in to maximize success at the box office.
